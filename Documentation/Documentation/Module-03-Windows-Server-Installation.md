# Engineering Decisions

## Why Desktop Experience? 

My explanation: Adeskstop Experience is a Windows Setup that comes with a GUI, which makes the user experience much easier and more comfortable.

---

## Why Custom Installation?

My explanation: Custom Installation allows a clean installation. This means it allows the file system of our Windows Server to be downloaded to the empty VDI (virtual hard disk) of our virtual machine. On the other hand, an upgrade installation only updates the operating system already installed in a VDI.

## Why 4 GB RAM?

My explanation: The host computer has a total of 8GB of RAN, and we allocated 4GB to our Virtual Machine to prevent the host from running out of resources and becoming unresponsive.
