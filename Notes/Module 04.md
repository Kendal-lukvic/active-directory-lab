## Active Directory Family

### Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)

Purpose:

Provides centralized authentication, authorization, and identity management for users, computers, and groups within a Windows domain.

---

### Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS)

Purpose:

Provides digital certificates and public key infrastructure (PKI).

---

### Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)

Purpose:

Provides Single Sign-On (SSO) for applications and external services.

---

### Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services (AD LDS)

Purpose:

Provides directory services without requiring a Windows domain.
## Dependencies

### Definition

A dependency is a software component or feature that another application or server role requires to function correctly.

### My Own Explanation

When installing a server role, Windows may automatically require additional features or management tools. These dependencies ensure the role can be configured, managed, and maintained properly after installation.

---

## Management Tools

### Definition

Administrative tools that allow administrators to configure, monitor, and troubleshoot Windows Server roles.

### Examples

- Active Directory Administrative Center
- AD DS Snap-ins
- Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell
## Why Active Directory Requires DNS

### Definition

Active Directory depends on DNS to locate Domain Controllers and other domain services.

### My Own Explanation

When a client computer wants to authenticate to the domain, it first uses DNS to locate a Domain Controller. Without DNS, clients would not know where to send authentication requests, so Active Directory would not function correctly.

---

## High Availability

### Definition

High availability is the practice of deploying multiple servers that provide the same service so that if one server fails, another can continue operating.

### My Own Explanation

Organizations usually deploy at least two Domain Controllers so users can continue logging in even if one Domain Controller fails.

## Domain Controller Options

### Forest Functional Level

Definition:

Defines the minimum Windows Server version that all Domain Controllers in the forest must support.

My own explanation:

The forest functional level determines which Windows Server versions can participate as Domain Controllers within the Active Directory forest.

---

### Domain Functional Level

Definition:

Defines the minimum Windows Server version supported within a specific domain.

My own explanation:

The domain functional level controls compatibility and available Active Directory features for a particular domain.

---

### Global Catalog (GC)

Definition:

A searchable index that helps users and services quickly locate Active Directory objects.

My own explanation:

The Global Catalog allows Active Directory to locate users, groups, and computers more efficiently without searching the entire directory.

---

### DSRM

Definition:

Directory Services Restore Mode is a special recovery mode used to repair or restore Active Directory.

## NetBIOS Name

### DNS Domain Name (FQDN)

lukvic.local

### NetBIOS Name

LUKVIC

### Purpose

The NetBIOS name is the short name of the Active Directory domain. It is primarily maintained for compatibility with older Windows systems and legacy applications.

### Important

The NetBIOS name identifies the domain, **not** a specific Domain Controller.

Example:

LUKVIC\kendal
My own explanation:

The DSRM password is used only when booting into recovery mode to perform maintenance or restore Active Directory after serious problems.
